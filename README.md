# Personal Website

This my personal website. I used [TypeIt](https://typeitjs.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) JS while developing this project.

## Installation & Usage

Download the repository to your local.First `$ npm install` and then run the project with the `$ npm start` This Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

## Replacement and Reuse
The homepage tag in the `package.json` file and then [this npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) needs to be tracked.
