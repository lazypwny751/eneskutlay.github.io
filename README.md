# Personal Website

This my personal website. I used [TypeIt](https://typeitjs.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) JS while developing this project.

## Installation & Usage

Download the repository to your local. First, install the necessary files with `$ npm install`. Then run the project with `$ npm start`. This runs the application in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to project view it in the browser.

## Replacement and Reuse
Change the homepage tag in the `package.json` file and then follow [this npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)
